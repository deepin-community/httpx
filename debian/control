Description: next generation HTTP client
 HTTPX is a fully featured HTTP client for Python 3, which provides sync and
 async APIs, and support for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.
 .
 HTTPX is a high performance asynchronous HTTP client, that builds on the
 well-established usability of requests, and gives you:
 .
  * A broadly requests-compatible API.
  * Standard synchronous interface, but with async support if you need it.
  * HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 support.
  * Ability to make requests directly to WSGI applications or ASGI applications.
  * Strict timeouts everywhere.
  * Fully type annotated.
  * 99% test coverage.
 .
 Plus all the standard features of requests:
 .
  * International Domains and URLs
  * Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling
  * Sessions with Cookie Persistence
  * Browser-style SSL Verification
  * Basic/Digest Authentication
  * Elegant Key/Value Cookies
  * Automatic Decompression
  * Automatic Content Decoding
  * Unicode Response Bodies
  * Multipart File Uploads
  * HTTP(S) Proxy Support
  * Connection Timeouts
  * Streaming Downloads
  * .netrc Support
  * Chunked Requests
